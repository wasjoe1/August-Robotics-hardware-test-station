# augustbot-tools

A collection of debug tools primarily written in Python and Bash.

This repository is supposed to be put in `~/catkin_ws/src/` so that
ROS can index and search the sub-folders for scripts. 

Be forewarned the dependencies are not configured here,
you will have to get all ROS-related stuff pre-configured,
including (1) ROS workspace (2) custom message types.

Further system-wide dependencies will be described in the
respective README residing in the `*_tools` folders.
